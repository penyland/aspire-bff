# Aspire BFF sample

This repository contains a sample solution based on the Aspire template aspire-ts-cs-starter (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/aspire-sdk-templates?pivots=dotnet-cli) with the addition of a Backend for Frontend (BFF) project.
The BFF project is an ASP.NET Core Web API using YARP to proxy requests to the api as well as proxying requests to the Aspire frontend project built with React and TypeScript.
